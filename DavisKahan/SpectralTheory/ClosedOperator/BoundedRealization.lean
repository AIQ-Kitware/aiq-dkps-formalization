# Bounded realizations of closed operators

A closed operator whose domain is the whole space is the restriction of a
bounded operator.  `BoundedRealization` packages that bounded operator together
with the domain identity and the agreement statement.

This file is deliberately independent of the spectral hypotheses that usually
produce such a realization: the structure is pure bookkeeping, so it belongs
with the closed-operator basics rather than with any particular criterion.
