/-! # Stability of minimizers under approximate minimization

If a sequence `z k` lives in a compact set and each `z k` *approximately*
minimizes a continuous real function `F` — for every point `x`, `F (z k) ≤
F x + ε x k` with `ε x k → 0` — then a subsequence of `z k` converges to a
genuine global minimizer of `F`.

This is the elementary "recovery" half of the fundamental theorem of
Γ-convergence: a perturbed family of variational problems whose minimizers stay
in a fixed compact set has a limit point that solves the unperturbed problem.
The typical source of the approximate-minimizer hypothesis is a second family
`F k` with `z k ∈ argmin (F k)` and `F k → F` in a suitable uniform sense.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_subseq_tendsto_forall_le_of_approxMin`
* `TauCeti.exists_subseq_tendsto_isMinOn_of_approxMinOn` — the variant where the
  approximate-minimization comparison ranges only over the compact set `K`, so the
  limit is a minimizer *on `K`* (`IsMinOn F K`) rather than a global one. This is
  the form the Berge maximum theorem consumes (the feasible set is constrained).

## Staging note

Staged for Mathlib: additions to `Mathlib/Topology/Order/Compact.lean` (companion
to `IsCompact.exists_isMinOn`), or a dedicated file alongside
`Mathlib/Topology/Sequences.lean`.
Formalized by Claude Opus 4.8 (claude-opus-4-8[1m]);
to be re-authored per Mathlib's AI-contribution policy at PR time.

## Provenance

* Original repository: Davis--Kahan/DKPS formalization (Kitware, Inc.).
* Original module: authored directly in `ForMathlib` at Davis--Kahan commit
  `72b913b`; it has had no prior home.
* Extraction class: **authored in place**, for upstreaming to Mathlib rather than
  to Tau Ceti — see `ForTauCeti/README.md` on the split between the two staging
  areas.
* Intended Mathlib home: additions to `Mathlib/Topology/Order/Compact.
* Original authors / copyright: Jon Crall, Claude Opus 4.8; Copyright (c) 2026
  Kitware, Inc.; Apache 2.0.
* Spectra influence: **none** — the `ForTauCeti` import firewall admits only
  Mathlib, `TauCeti` and `ForTauCeti` (rule 2 of
  `scripts/check_dependency_layers.py`); this module imports Mathlib only.

Moved from `ForMathlib/Topology/` to `ForTauCeti/Topology/` on 2026-07-29 by lane
FM-RETIRE, which finishes the `ForMathlib` retirement.  The namespace changed from
`ForMathlib` to `TauCeti` to match the destination package; declaration names,
statements and proofs are unchanged.

**Stability of minimizers under approximate minimization.**

Let `K` be a compact subset of a first-countable topological space, `F : X → ℝ`
continuous, and `z : ℕ → X` a sequence in `K` such that each `z k` approximately
minimizes `F`: for every `x`, `F (z k) ≤ F x + ε x k`, where `ε x k → 0` as
`k → ∞` (the error may depend on the comparison point `x`). Then there is a
strictly monotone `φ` and a point `ψ ∈ K` with `z ∘ φ → ψ` and `ψ` a global
minimizer of `F` (`∀ x, F ψ ≤ F x`).

**Stability of constrained minimizers under approximate minimization.**

The constrained variant of `exists_subseq_tendsto_forall_le_of_approxMin`: the
approximate-minimization bound is only required to hold for comparison points `x`
*in the compact set* `K` (`F (z k) ≤ F x + ε x k` for `x ∈ K`), and the limit
point `ψ` is correspondingly a minimizer of `F` *on `K`* (`IsMinOn F K ψ`) rather
than a global minimizer.  This is the form consumed by the Berge maximum theorem,
where the feasible set is the fixed compact `K`.
